## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This was my first time working with Tailwind CSS, it was great to see Tailwind CSS in the actions. With the text formating and typography, it was really helpful but I had a problem to setup up the sizes of rows and columns in the grid and I used CSS for it
```js
gridTemplateColumns: {
  'midScreen': "1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr",
  'bigScreen': "3fr 3fr max-content 3fr",
},
gridTemplateRows: {
  'midScreen' : 'minmax(300px, 435px) 80px min(30vw, 250px) min(30vw, 250px)',
  'bigScreen' : 'minmax(300px, 435px) 80px min(30vw, 250px)'
},
```

During resizing the page from big to small last row of the grid acted weird and I added another media query. It work better than before but still it has white spaces but I couldn't figured out another way to solve this problem.
